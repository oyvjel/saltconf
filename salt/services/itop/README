2. INSTALLATION
   ============

2.1. Requirements
     ------------
iTop configuration:
TeemIp 2.0.2-rc requires iTop 2.0.3 minimum.
 
Server configuration:
TeemIp as an iTop module doesn't require anything more than what iTop requires.

End-user configuration:
Although TeemIp should work with most modern web browsers, the application has been tested mostly with Firefox 3, 
IE8, IE9, Safari 5 and Chrome. TeemIp was designed for at least a 1024x768 screen resolution.


2.2. Install procedure
     -----------------
1) Unpack the files contained in the zipped package, and copy the content of the "web" directory into your current
   iTop web diretory. TeemIp directories should appear in the web/extensions directory. 
2) Make sure that the configuration file located at web/conf/production/config-itop.php is writable by the 
   web server (on Windows: remove the "read-only" flag, on Linux adjust the rights of the file).
3) Re-launch the installation process by pointing your browser to web/setup/ and follow the indications on the 
   screen. 

That's it.


3. FEATURES
   ========

3.1. Changes since 2.0.1
     -------------------
WAN Links
---------
- WAN link types are now typology elements and the "Type" attribute is selected through a combo box.
- Next to the attribute "Rate", you can now document a "Burst Rate" and an "Underlying Rate".
- The "Carrier" attribute is no longer a text field but a pointer to an Organisation. That should ease management of
links provided by a given carrier.
- Next to the carrier reference, an internal reference can be documented.
- A new "Move to production date" can be registered.
- A new "Decommissioning date" attribute will tell you when your links has been obsoleted.

AS Numbers
----------
- "Registrar" of an AS number no longer is a text field but a pointer to an organization.
                
Domain Names
------------
- The "Internet Registrar" of a domain is no longer a text field but a pointer to an organization.
                
IP Blocks
---------
- An allocation date can now be registered for Blocks . This new attribute is automatically updated when object is created.
- Some autocompletion feature has been added to ease the handling of IPv6 addresses.

IP Subnets
----------
- An allocation date can now be registered for Subnets . This new attribute is automatically updated when object is created.
- Subnet calculator gives now the IP of the previous and next subnets (if any) of the same size.
- Some autocompletion feature has been added to ease the handling of IPv6 addresses.

IP Ranges
---------
- An allocation date can now be registered for Ranges . This new attribute is automatically updated when object is created.
- Some autocompletion feature has been added to ease the handling of IPv6 addresses.

IP Addresses
------------
- Contacts and documents can now be attached to an IP address

IP Objects
----------
- Allocation and release dates have been moved to abstract class IP Object. In order to ease the migration, a procedure is 
executed when the TeemIp is upgraded to move these 2 attributes from leave classes to the IP Object one.
 
IP Requests
-----------
- When a request for a new IP is created (directly or through the portal), requestors may ask to attach the IP to a specific 
device. If the IP is a management IP, device's attribute is automatically updated. If it is part of a physical or logical 
interface attached to the device, it remains up to the agent handling the ticket to create the interface. 
- Contact tab now appears in the detail of an IP ticket.
- On the portal, the list of attributes of the search filter has been extended.

Miscellaneous fixes
-------------------
- Creating a delegated block directly from the block creation page was displaying a fatal error window, though the delegated 
block was created.
- Calculation of CIDR alignement for subnets was not working well.
- Display of CSV IPs within subnets and ranges was not working anymore due to an obsolete IP address attribute.
- Automatic calculation of IP range when new IP is created has been fixed.

Localization
------------
TeemIp is available in German, English and French!

Because TeemIp relies on iTop and because iTop is available in 11 different languages, TeemIp could be available within 
the same languages at a translation cost that is not too high. Indeed, less than 1500 entries that are specific to 
TeemIp modules need to be translated. Should you volunteer to translate TeemIp modules, please, contact 
xtophe38@users.sourceforge.net. I'll provide you with the files that need translation.


3.4. Known limitations (https://sourceforge.net/p/)
     -----------------
- when attaching an IP address to a physical or virtual interface, all IPs from all organizations can be used.


3.5. Known issues (https://sourceforge.net/p/teemip/tickets/)
     ------------
#1 Deleting a cascaded list of subnet blocks will generate an exception and all blocks won't be delete as requested. 
However, system will not be affected and operations can continue. This bug comes from the deletion policy for the 
type of hierarchical key used to define subnet blocks.
