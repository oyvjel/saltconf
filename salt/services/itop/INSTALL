Prerequisites:
		 
TeemIp 2.0.2-rc module requires an iTop instance, version 2.0.3 minimum:
- currently up and running
- or on the point to be installed together with TeemIp extension.

All iTop requirements do remain necessary to install TeemIp as an iTop module.

Installation:

1. Unzip the distribution (be sure to unzip the subdirectories) and copy the
   content of the "web" directory in your webserver's document root. TeemIp 
   modules shoud appear in the web/extensions/ directory. If you don't have 
   direct access to the web server's file system, put the files in a directory 
   on your local machine and transfer the content of the directory on your web 
   server using, for example, ftp.

2. Ensure that all the scripts have the appropriate owner (if PHP is running in
   safe mode, having some scripts with an owner different from the owner of
   other scripts will be a problem).

3. If you add TeemIp modules to an already installed iTop application, make sure
   that the file web/conf/production/config-itop.php is r/w.

4. Open the main iTop directory in your web browser and follow the installation
   instructions.
